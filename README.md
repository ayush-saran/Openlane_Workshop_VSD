# Openlane_Workshop_VSD
This repository will reflect the work done in the Advanced Physical Design Flow workshop, offered by the folks at VSD. It's a 5 day workshop that aims to educate us on the intricacies of Open Source EDA tools and PDKs as used by industry leaders. Furthermore, it uses Openlane flow to help understand the flow of work when it comes to VLSI designs, starting from the RTL level to the GSDII stage, performing the synthesis, placement, floorplanning, routing and sta required to do so.
